            <h3>Who I Am</h3>
            <p>I've been told that I'm difficult to shop for. I like to see the wonder of nature, feel the air vibrate from powerful engines, hear the joyful laughter of my kids as they play at the park, and to taste the melody of flavors of a pizza crafted to perfection. We don't know how long we have on this rock we all call home, so the memories I create with others are more important to me than some trivial knickknack that might break and get thrown away tomorrow. Eleven Fifty Academy has afforded me the opportunity to reduce my time cost in order to join this wonderful field of software development.</p>

                <p>My first organic creation with HTML and CSS. I'm not a designer, so I had to scale back my orginal idea. I try to not copy and paste code because I want to be able to fully understand what each element of my code is doing.</p>

                <p>I had a prioritization/procrastination issue at the begining of the program. My goal is to fill a to be announced section with a completed project.</p>

                <h3>Console Application RPG Game</h3>
                <p>This was a project that I did with one of my classmate s. In the group, I focused more on the storyline because I have a vivid imagination. Yet still managed to come up with some decent code.</p>
